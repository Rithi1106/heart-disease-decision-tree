Heart Disease Prediction using Logistic Regression ❤️🩺

This project uses a Logistic Regression model to predict the presence of heart disease in a patient based on various health-related features.

📊 Dataset

- **Source**: `heart.csv`
- **Target column**: `HeartDisease` (1 = Disease, 0 = No Disease)
- **Features** include:
  - Age
  - Sex
  - ChestPainType
  - RestingBP
  - Cholesterol
  - FastingBS
  - MaxHR
  - ExerciseAngina
  - Oldpeak
  - ST_Slope
  - and more...

🧠 Model Used

- **Logistic Regression** from `sklearn.linear_model`
- Performance evaluated using:
  - Accuracy Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report
  - ROC-AUC Score

✅ Results

- **Model Accuracy**: ~82.6%
- Confusion Matrix & Classification Report included in the notebook
- Clean visualizations using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`
